# Emergence

An easy-to-use graphical frontend for Synergy.

# Requirements

Emergence has been built, and designed, for Mac OS X 10.5 or later.

In  order to build Emergence you will need to [download] [1] Synergy and install
the two binaries, synergyc and synergys, under the following directory:

    Synergy/synergy-1.3.1

The Xcode project depends on the Synergy binaries being at this location so that
Emergence includes them within its application bundle.
